Bio
Hey, I'm Mohamed (Momo) 👋
I’m a Computer Science student at Zagazig University, currently in my final term. I spend most of my time building and deploying ML models, but I’m really more about solving the "right" problems than just writing code.

🛠 What I’m good at:

ML Engineering: I like the whole cycle—from engineering features to deploying with Streamlit or Flask.
+1


NLP: Spent some good time working with spaCy and building tools like Hate Speech bots.
+1


Tools: Python is my main language, but I’m comfortable with SQL and have a solid foundation in C++ and Java from my studies.

🏟 When I'm not coding:
I’m probably watching Al Ahly or Barcelona. Big fan of Messi and Aboutrika.

I enjoy a good crime drama—Breaking Bad and The Godfather are my all-time favorites.

Catching a "Ziyada" coffee on the Nile corniche in Zifta is my way of recharging.

🏗 Current Focus:
Right now, I'm focusing on my Graduation Project—using YOLO to detect exam cheating—and building a Football Intelligence Lab for my portfolio.
